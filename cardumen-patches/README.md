# astor-cardumen-experiments

## Open-science repo for Cardumen patches.

Explanation about  the folders:

1. `unformatted-patches` contains all the Cardumen patches. Due to a bug in our tool, the diffs have  wrong line numbers, which correspond to the line number of the files *after* removing the comments and JavaDoc. 

2. `patches` folder contains a subset of patches with the correct line numbers.

3. The `patched_programs` folder contains the patched programs for patches from folder `patches`
